# 2FA

A dead-simple Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) One-Time-Password (OTP) generator command-line tool written in Python3. Reduced from [py2fa](https://github.com/cpiehl/py2fa) which offers a Graphical (Gtk) user interface.

```bash
cp 2fa.json.sample 2fa.json
# Edit to fit your needs; the json format is self-explainatory.
# Then run
./2fa.py
```
